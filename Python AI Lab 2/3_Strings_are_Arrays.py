
#  strings in Python are technically arrays of bytes representing unicode characters. However, unlike most other languages, they are immutable, which means they cannot be changed once created.

# Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.

# The first character has the position 0 :

name = "S M Asiful Islam Saky"

print(name[2])  #M
print(name[0])  #S
print(name[7])  #f
print(name[5])  #s
print(name[9])  #l
