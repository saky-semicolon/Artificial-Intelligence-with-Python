Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. It is a widely used language, with a large and comprehensive standard library and a wide range of packages and modules available to extend its capabilities. Python is particularly well suited to web development, scripting, scientific computing and data analysis. It has a straightforward, easy-to-learn syntax which makes it a good language for beginners to learn. It is highly extensible, with powerful object-oriented programming capabilities and many libraries that extend its functionality. Python is also cross-platform, meaning it can be used on different operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and Unix.
